# Animation 1
This animation can be used to display eye catching information such as the Stock Ticker, or a limited time offer. This animation is actually the replacement of the now depricated <marquee> tag.

# Animation 2
This animation is most useful when you want to make the Website look more dynamic to the viewer, since the elements are appearing as the viewer scrolls, i.e. we give the control to the viewer.
